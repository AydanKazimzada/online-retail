# Customer Segmentation â€” AzMarket

This project demonstrates **customer segmentation** using clustering techniques (specifically, **K-Means**) on an online retail dataset.
The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior to help improve marketing strategy, customer retention, and product targeting.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a key technique in marketing analytics.
In this notebook, we:

1. Load and simulate online retail data for Azerbaijan.
3. Perform **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis to quantify customer behavior.
4. Apply **K-Means clustering** to segment customers.
5. Interpret customer segments to derive actionable insights.

## Results Summary

* Customers were grouped into **distinct segments** such as:

  * **High-value frequent buyers**
  * **Occasional shoppers**
  * **Recent one-time buyers**
* The segmentation enables **targeted marketing** and **better retention planning**.
